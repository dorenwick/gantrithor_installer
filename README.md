# gantrithor_installer
This repo is for constructing installers for the gantrithor

1: We run pyinstaller: pyinstaller Main.spec
2: We run the exe_coded.nsi file on the NSIS software
3: This makes the installer

MISC:
If we are going to be doing this a lot, we should make a script to take out the big dll files into the excluded area.


We want to add some instructions here:

Use the exe_coded file in D:\Gantrithor.zip 

That file goes into NSIS script program
